wind energy today offers one of the most economical sources of electricity in most countries across the world and is a major factor in driving a new era in a global energy transition.

Wind turbines, like windmills, are mounted on a tower to capture the most energy. They can take advantage of the faster and less turbulent wind at 100 feet (30 meters) or more above ground. Turbines catch the windâ€™s energy with their propeller-like blades. Usually, two or three blades are mounted on a shaft to form a rotor

Wind turbines can be used as stand-alone applications, or they can be connected to a utility power grid or even combined with a photovoltaic (solar cell) system. For utility-scale (megawatt-sized) sources of wind energy, a large number of wind turbines are usually built close together to form a wind plant, also referred to as a wind farm. Several electricity providers today use wind plants to supply power to their customers.
